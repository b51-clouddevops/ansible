# 1. Now a default root password will be generated and can be seen in the log file.

# ```bash
# # grep temp /var/log/mysqld.log
# ( Copy that password )
# ```

# 1. Next, We need to change the default root password in order to start using the database service. Use password as `RoboShop@1` . Rest of the options you can choose `No`

# ```bash
# # mysql_secure_installation
# ```

# 1. You can check whether the new password is working or not using the following command in MySQL

# First let's connect to MySQL

# ```bash
# # mysql -uroot -pRoboShop@1
# ```

# Once after login to MySQL prompt then run this SQL Command. This will uninstall the password validation feature like number of characters, password length, complexty and all. As I don’t want that I’d be uninstalling the `validate_password` plugin

# To download schema, Use the following command

# ```bash
# # curl -s -L -o /tmp/mysql.zip "https://github.com/stans-robot-project/mysql/archive/main.zip"
# ```

# Load the schema for mysql. This file contains the list of COUNTRIES, CITIES and their PINCODES. This will be helpful in doing the shipping charges calculation which is based on the distance the product is shippied
